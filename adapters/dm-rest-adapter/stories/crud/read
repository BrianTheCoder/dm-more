Story: remote app wants to access one or more Resources
  As a remote app
  I want to get one or more Resources
  So that I can take an action based upon the information

  Scenario: remote app requests all Resources of a particular type
    Given a DataMapper::Resource representing a type of Resource
    When I request all of the Resources of that type
    Then I should not receive an empty list
    
  Scenario: remote app requests an existng Resource by its ID
    Given a DataMapper::Resource representing a type of Resource
    And the ID of an existing Resource
    When I request the Resource
    Then I should receive that Resource
    
  Scenario: remote app request a non-existing Resource by its ID
    Given a DataMapper::Resource representing a type of Resource
    And the ID of a nonexistent Resource
    When I request the Resource
    Then I should get nothing in return
